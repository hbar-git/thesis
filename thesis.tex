\section{Introduction}

In this thesis we use ADE classification of the Dynkin diagrams of T-matrices
to determine their symmetry groups.

\section{Conclusion}

The results obtained from the ADE classification of the T-matrices clearly are
a simple list of Dynkin diagrams, with coefficients that correspond to the
subgroups of Lie algebra.
